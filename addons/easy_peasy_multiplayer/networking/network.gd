#region MultiplayerAPI Signals

## Callback function that runs whenever a new player connects to the local client (Not necessarily the server in general. This was a misconception I had which confused me).

	connected_players.erase(id)
	players_ready.erase(id)

#region Ready RPCs
## This rpc can be called on any client, and should be passed to the server to register that player's ready state. The local client's ready state should be passed into [param toggled_on] so that the server knows what ready state the client is on.
##
## [br][br]
##
## Example code to run on clients when they ready: [code] ready_state.rpc_id(1, is_ready) [/code]
@rpc("any_peer", "call_local", "reliable")
func ready_state(toggled_on : bool):
	if multiplayer.is_server():
		var sender_id = multiplayer.get_remote_sender_id() # This function is like magic to me but it's so convenient

		if toggled_on and !players_ready.has(sender_id):
			players_ready.append(sender_id)
		elif !toggled_on:
			players_ready.erase(sender_id)

		propagate_ready_states.rpc(players_ready) # Updates the ready states on all clients

## This rpc should only be called on the host, sending the ready states to all of the players. This sort of rpc is server-authoratative, which is more secure than clients having authority, so long as the host is not malicious (it would be most secure when the server is hosted seperately from any of the players, but that also means having to maintain dedicated servers, which I most definitely do not have the money for, so I have not thought about implementing it).
